# Predictive Learning Analytics

## Overview

The Predictive Learning Analytics project is a machine learning-based web application built with Flask. It predicts student performance based on various input features such as gender, class, attended classes, total classes, and math scores.
## Project Components

The project consists of the following components:

1. **predictive-learning.py**: This Python script contains the code for data preparation, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. It uses machine learning models to predict student performance.

2. **Flask.py**: The Flask-based web application that serves as the user interface for inputting student data and obtaining predictions. It uses the trained machine learning model to make predictions.

3. **index.html**: The HTML template for the web interface, allowing users to input student data.

4. **styles.css**: The CSS stylesheet for styling the web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- joblib (for loading the trained model)
- jQuery (for handling form submissions in the HTML template)



### Project Structure
The repository structure is organized as follows:

- predictive-learning.py: Python script containing data preparation, model building, and evaluation.
- Flask.py: Flask web application for serving the machine learning model.
- index.html: HTML template for the web interface.
- styles.css: CSS stylesheet for styling the web interface.
